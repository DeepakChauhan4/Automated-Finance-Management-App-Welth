To fix the "Tenant or user not found" error caused by PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) on the "users" table, please follow these steps:

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database using a database GUI (e.g., pgAdmin, DBeaver, Supabase dashboard) or the psql CLI.

2. Run the following SQL commands to disable RLS on the "users" table:

   ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

3. Run your Prisma migrations:

   npx prisma migrate deploy

4. After successful migration, re-enable RLS on the "users" table:

   ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

Notes:
- If you use psql CLI, ensure your connection string is properly URL-encoded, especially if your password contains special characters like '@'.
- Example of URL-encoded connection string:

  postgresql://username:password@host:port/database

  Replace '@' in password with '%40'.

- If you need help with URL encoding or running these commands, please ask.

This manual process bypasses the issues with the migration script and connection string parsing.

After completing these steps, test your application again to confirm the error is resolved.
